Abstract
In 1925 a file of over _10,000 sensitive highly secret

?ecrypts from World War I Room 40 cryptanalysis were compromised
in London to an American lawyer. He took several hundred
- ·- -or··tn.e--decrypts out of Britain and in 1927 turned them over
to the German government, in a lawsuit. Within weeks the
German Army and German Foreign Of'rice embarked on intensive
and urgent programs to improve their cryptography. The steckered
Enigma, and greatly increased production and use of one time
pad were the direct results of these programs. The decrypts
contained extremely derogatory information about German biowar
and covert operations in neutral countries during World War I.
The decrypts and associated lawsuit were widely publicized,
and occupied the highest levels of the German government

The Room 40 Compromise

(u)

The consequences of compromising or declassifying
• decrypted messages are often difficult to identify. Part
of the tragjc background to World War II was the compromise
of hundreds of political decrypts produced by Room 40 during
the interwar period. What is unique about this compromise
is that captured German documents show a sudden and urgent
intensification in German military and diplomatic cryptography,
which began a few weeks after the compromjsed decrypts were
put in their hands in March 1927. The steckered Enigma was
one of th~ developments. A considerable intensification of
one time pad production and use was another. Nothing showed
up in German traffic at the time --- the changes were much
'
more fundamental,
and were manifested years later in the nonexpoitability of many crucial German nets.
Soon after the highly secret decrypts escaped control,

""'
the "i~olable
secret" of Room 40 got into the newspapers,
with a fanout of disclosures by people who had pledged to
keep the secret. Admiralty tried to stifle this outpouring
of cryptologic secrets, and suppressed books by several prominent
people, but too late. In the detente of the period the
preservation of wartime secrets was treated as no longer
necessary.
The Germans however, after they got the decrypts,
clamped the tightest secrecy on their cryptographic

innovatio~s.

backed up by the 1914 wartime secrecy law.* The political
climate of the time, and the ideological motives of several
of the key figures were important factors in how the compromise
occurred, and the consequences that came from it. Years later
the compro~ise was described as an authorized declassificatic~
of the decrypts, but the available evidence contradicts this.

s

The cost to Britain and the U.S. of the cryptographic
developments the Germans embarked on after the Roora 40 decryp~s
reached them was profound, irrevocable, and long lasting.

At the time the compromise occurred, no one in Britain
or the U .. S. grasped what the consequences would be. Even i f
they ~orecast the effects correctly,
they could prove nothfng
because the Germans

had adopted a friendly outward appearance.

Gradually documents and recprds accrued ,·some classified
some

unclassi~ied,

which

and

could allow a reconstruction of

what had happened.
The central point of the story is simple
but unpleasant, viz: disclosing decrypts or other cryptologic
secrets is immensely damaging to future intelligence and
warfighting capability.

Peaslee met Hall at the latter's Lo11don residence, 63
Cadogan Gardens, on Thursday, August ::z7, 1925. He
presented his credentials and told his mission.
After what seemed hours ·lo Peaslee, during which
llall's famous eyes pierced Peaslee's "immortal soul,"
Hall snapped out, "Well, I will do it."
He led Peaslee to a place full of filing cabinets containing over 1opoo decoded German cables and radiograms. Hall hod read and.decoded every one which the
Germans had sent or received during the war!
JiVhat Peaslee then saw quite took his breath away.
They were the records-..!!!J;.-d(f(;uments which had been
locked up in 1919 "11ot to be opened u11til ::zo years after

to see.
Before the cables wer~_;p.o}:iy released for use of the
American government Hall took the mailer up with the
appropriate British authorities, and the way was cleared.
He told Peaslee:
"I am going on a shooting trip lo Scot'land, but my
house and servants are yours and )'OU may live here

·Sims' account is Peaslee's version of what happened,
tailored for the public record 17 years after the event. James'
account, which claims prior

authorization before Peaslee saw

the decrypts, was written over 30 years after the event in an
admiring biography of Hall.

A distinctly different account was

given in 1937, some 12 years after the eventJ by Landau --- in
which Hall explicitly did not get authorization. In Landau's
narrative, Hall told Peaslee the decrypts were stored "in
several tin boxes in my basement".[38A] Hall decided on the
spot to disregard the 20 year secrecy caveat, and told Peaslee
he could copy any cables he wanted to. Hall then left for grouse
shooting in Scotland that afternoon, putting

his house at

Peaslee's disposal. In Landau's account:
"His rapid and sweeping decision was typical of
the man. Fortunately he was retired from the Navy
and was, therefore, his own master". [38B]

9

(v)

Landau of course was not an eyewitness, but neither were
of James.

Landau's book The Enemy Within

Sims

is a detailed account

of the whole World War I sabotage operation and the legal case
that followed it.

Landau, a former wartime British Secret

Service officer, had assisted the investigation, knew many of
•

\\Y

the principal characters well, and had gotten "the personal
stories".[38C].

(v)

In particular, Landau had no axe to grind.

There are a number of implications of the Sims' account
which support Landau's version of the incident. Peaslee went
through the 10,000 decrypts between Thursday afternoon and
Sunday afternoon, and it is unlikely that a government archive
.:i

DOC ID : 3 97851 6

-~

containing such sensitive political materials would have been
kept open over a weekend for an uncleared American private
citizen. Landau says Peaslee worked in Hall's house. [38D].
Sims states that Hall madQhis house available for Peaslee to
work in, so the file of decrypts could hardly have been
anywhere else.

Sims says that before the cables were "finally released"
for the use of' the "American government" Hall took the matter
up with the appropriate British authorities, but that could
have been long afterwards. Sims never says when

Hall went

to the "appropriate authorities" or who they were. James is
equally uninformative. Since Hall left directly for Scotland
there was really no time to get an official release, and
neither G.C.&C.S. nor Admiralty would have let an unknown
American cart such files off to Hall's house, or browse through
them over a weekend.

Some Room 40 records were gathering

dust in an attic in Admiralty in 1937 [39], but in 1925 G.C.&C.S.
was administratively under the Foreign Office. [40] Very high
level Foreign Office authorization would have been needed to
release these sensitive political decrypts because they were
covered by the Official Secrets Act. [41]
Office disliked Hall,

Since the Foreign

they had little motivation to

'

let Peaslee read and copy files which even senior British
officials could not have seen without high level clearance.\\:_~z]
Authority to release such sensitive political materials to
a foreign national, or to the American government, would lie
outside Admiralty authority.B$JFurther, Rritish polir.y in
1925 was sympathetic to the Germans, and the 1924 Dawes Plan

("'4]
had been encouraged by Britain --- so releasing

decrypts

that would injure the German government would conflict with
that policy.

disposal~~~e

also permitted

Peaslee does not

say that the British Government gave him access or permission
to take away copies.

Once Peaslee got the decrypts out of

England, the situation was out of the control of the British
government, and they may have decided to do nothing further
to oppose the use of the decrypts because they didn't want
publicity about GCCS, and had no real choice.

The fact

tha~

neither Sims, nor James nor Hall nor Peaslee ever identifies
who authorized the release lends an air of mystery. If Hall

since Hall was an Member of Parliament, and had the title

One very interesting point is that no one else disclosed
anything about Room 40 publicly until November 1925, months
after the decrypts had been givPn to

Peaslee[~~].

Prosperity through Pacifism
~

· After

World War I there was considerable public interest

in disarmament, even though the governments were fearful of

Russian expansion.

The U.S. had a naval building program to
1§"€.'J

give parity with the wartime British Navy. The British did not
get the German warships because they were scuttled at Scapa

ir7J

Flow.

As a result the British Coalition Government under LLoyd

George had to .face the question nf a Naval building program
at a time when they had big debts, a large Army in Germany,
[~]

and the world economy was still devastated by the

~·Jar.

~<t]

cuts and discharges were initiated. Hall had a keen

inte~est

in

Naval and Merchant Service matters, and made his maiden speech
the day he joined Parli&ment 13 March 1919 on the Navy's
~oJ

service in the war, and on pay and pensions for the Navy. The
Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22 resulted in commitments
to reduce the Royal N&vy and to stop building major

warships.~U

Sir Eric Geddes, former Firet Lord of the Admiralty, made
severe cuts in the Navy budget in 1922 and many long service

[!.iJ

officers were summarily discharged. A crisis between Greece
and Turkey at Chanak in 1922 brought a threat of war to
Britain and the Empire, and public rejection of this

the

British people wanted disarmament and no commitments

led to

a breakup of the Coalition Government and the resignation of
LLoyd

Bonar Law became Conservative Prime Mini st er,

while Lord Curzon the Foreign Secretary began to reassert
the authority of the Foreign Office, which had lost power to

The Germans had become allied

proj,ects developed between them. At the same time the
Germans cultivated the British and Americans to offset the

pressure from the French.

It was possible to see, in the

combination of German industrial capability and Russian
resources, a potential threat. The British Government feared

In 1922 Lord Curzon had G.C.&C.S. and the

cryptanalytic mission transferred totally from Admiralty
to the Foreign Office --- ending Admiralty control of that

critical intelligence.

Even the DF mission was transferred

at a time when radio interception and DF were still extremely

secret.

Austen Chamberlain in 1921-22 had caused considerable

stress within the Conservative Party by taking a leading part
in negotiating with the Sinn Fein (whom Hall had fought
bitterly during the war) for the establishment of the Irish
[-r1]

Free State. In late 1923 the Conservative Party under Baldwin

was badly defeated in a General Election --- even Churchill

There were severe battles

between Churchill and Beatty the FirRt Sea Lord, over the

Despite the treaty of 1922 Britain continued

to build cruisers to keep the shipyards active, but the Fleet

Air Arm was taken away.

Navies were regarded as "offensive"

systems and the major arms cuts

concern~d

them. Hall was

obviously well thoughtof by the Admiralty for they promoted
him in 1922 from Rear Admiral (Retired) to Vice Admiral (Retired),
and to Admiral (retired) in 1926 [81].
When he rejoined the Parliament in 1925 after an absence, he
(ogil
continued to champion Navy causes. However, in the climate of
detente --- which was based on trusting Germany and discounting
Russia --- Navy prospects were not encouraging.

The negotiations

in mid 1925 were very uncertain and required all of Chamberlain's
[tr31

energy. He got the Nobel Peace

Prize in 1925.for his efforts

(ftfl

(shared with Dawes). While the victors of World War I were
commited to a pacifist policy, and Europe basked in a feeling

(_v)

Hall on the Outside
This moralistic anti-war foreign policy, the budget cuts,
and the politics surrounding Chamberlain himselfl, all had
considerable significance in mid 1925 for "Blinker" Hall.
Hall, during his reign as DNI, had shown himself to be a
ruthless, ambitious opportunist, extending his tentacles into
Scotland Yard, M.I.6 and foreign

policy~~His

exploitation of

the Roger Casement diary was disapproved by many people at
ws]
as was his extreme secr.etiveness and tight
high levels,
1(

DOCID: 3978516
personal control over the diplomatic decrypts of Room 40.

~~

When the war ended he was summarily released from active
~~

Navy service.

He had expected to go to the Paris Peace

Conference as the Head of the Intelligence Bureau, but Sir
~Ll
Rosslyn Wemyss, first Sea Lord, rejected him. He had received
KCMG in October 1917, but was not included in any post-war
Honours List, although the other Directors of Military
r,~

Intelligence all received the Order of the Bath.

He had,

at the end of the war, been sp0ken of as a future

Foreig~

Secretary, but he had made too many enemies, and once he was
out 0£ the Navy he was never again taken into the

Government.~~

He accepted a Direct0rship with a large British company and,
his financial position assured, was elected to PRrliament
~~

representing a constituency in Liverpool.

Honored in 1919
~~

by Cambridge University and Oxford University, he became
involved in the Unionist Coalition Party orgenization at the
request of Prime Minister Bonar Law in 1923, against the strong
advice of his friends!-"'ij When the coalition was defeated he lost
his seat in Parliament and was subjected to an unscrupulous
vendetta of character assasination by his former political
~~

cohorts.

His health broke down and he resigned from the
~~
Party organization in March 1924. He ran again for Parliament
for Eastbourne and returned to London as an M.P. in 1925, at
~~
about the same time Peaslee's letter arrived.
After these
excoriating experiences, Hall may have hesitated to trust the
judgement of people in authority concerning the handling of
the Peaslee visit.i Hall was never reluctant to rely on his
own unaided judgement, no matter what the

outcome.

Whatever benefit Hall expected in lettrvra Peaslee at

German perfidy, he knew he was communicating and exposing

in 1927, by which time the British Army and Allied Control
Commission had left Germany_, and detente was in place.

Hall had caused sensational propaganda and become a
force in wartime policy by manipulating and releasing secret
uoi1
information, out he was not a cryptanalyst and was not at all
qualified to judge the strategic effect of' releasing verbatim

decrypts to the

Ger~ans.

James claimed in 1955 that

cryptanalysis had ended in 1919 because of' widespread cipher

.Jk-

changes, but that was neither true nor a defense --- since the
content of the decrypts was still sensitive. Hall was always
more of an opportunist and advGnturer than a strategist
as his personal career and several downfalls showed

and

even his "great coup" of' public exploitation of' the Zimmermann
telegram did not actually cause the USA to enter World War
I, although Hall may have th.:._pught so.LJ~]

What is evident is that the decrypts released to Peaslee,
if they had become public in 1925 instead of 1930, wouln have
been very upsetting to British negotiations and policies at
a critical stage in 1925.

was still extremely secret. Hall was a gambler but not a good

Room 40 secrets were disseminated, with far-reachjng effects
--- but probably not those Hall had in mind.

(v)

Peaslee's Brief'

From 1925 to 1927 Peaslee sorted out the decrypts, and
tracked down and interrogated various elusive witnesses, and
then he filed a lengthy brief with the Mixed Claims Commission
in Washington in two parts on 14 March 1927 and 25 March 1927,

D•o]

The German Army's Reaction
On 28 March 1927 ---just two weeks after the first
formal filing of the decrypts came into the hands of the
on.J
German Agent to the Mixed Claims Commission --- there was

I I'

a hastily called meeting between Cipher Machine A. G. (CMAG)
and the

Crypt~logid-

Agency of the War Ministry to improvise

changes to the lamp-panel Enigma by the introduction

of a

variable plugging between the endplate and the fast wheel [ 11'1-].
The Army had already adopted the unsteckered Enigma, which
was used in other German government departments, and was in
fact technically well ahead of all other armies in cipher
security [ ll'l> ] . But they changed the Enigma abruptly, and
imposed severe wartime secrecy laws on every aspect of the
design and manufacture [

llt.j ] .

had not been secret [ ll'IA].

Up to that point Enigma design

(The Germans also intensified

their secret rearmament program in 1927 [llS' ]).

At that March meeting CMAG

suggest~d

a pluggable reflector

""'
as well [lit.].
The Army insisted that the idea for the pluggable
endplate was its property, and therefore subject to the secrecy
law [ \\11 ] . On 2 May 1927 a contract was let to CMAG, specifying
the changes to the "small" Enigma (26 letter battery model)
and imposing total secrecy [Iii ]. A long trail of changes
and revisions over the next several years underscore the
haste of the stecker introduction [ ll't ] • Originally the
plugboard was to have 52 holes and 26 wires. On 17 February
1928 the Cryptologic Agency proposed the use of double-pole

..

contacts, with 13 plugwires [1zo ]. A CMAG memorandum about
the meeting noted that CMAG had filed a patent application on
9 August 1926 for the concept of a variable plugging in front
of or within the machine [121 ].

The Army had altered machine

Number A.336 to demonstrate the double-prdng plugboard [1zz].
The 52-hole plugboard had been rejected as a source of error

[12~].

The Army expected to use only 6 pairs of plugs at a time, the
other points being automatically self-steckered

[IL~].

By this

time 400 Enigma machines had been delivered with a 13 x 2
plugboard [rzS].
complicated

[r~'

CMAG considered the new plugboard more

]. On 1 March 1928 Siefert, Fenner and Schroeder

for the Army met Rinke, Scherbius and Korn of CMAG and there
was a squabble over the Patent application of 9 Aug 1926 [rz7 ].
The Army insisted that any plugging feature of the Enigma be
kept totally secret, and assumed the costs of the Patent Office
[1~~

].

On 30 March 1928 another CMAG/Army conference discussed

suppressing any mention of plugging from the CMAG Patent claims,
and keeping all pluggable Enigma variations and designs secret
[12...°I ] •

The Army was insistent [ r;o ] •

On 20 August 1928 CMAG

suggested a switch matrix to replace the double-pole plugs and
cables [ 131

] •

On 6 August 1929 there was an Army/CMAG

conference to replace the previous plugboard arrangement of
the "small Enigma" with a better one

[131.

] •

The Army wanted

two-prong plugs, but because of limited space in the radio
trucks any changes had to be very compact [

1~'3 ] •

CMAG proposed

commercial exploitation of the pluggable reflector, which they
considered their own property and had already offered to

DOCID: 3978516

'

Hungary [l~Y ]. The Army Cryptologic Agency refused the
pluggable reflector because it was not covered by the

1914

wartime secrets and treason law --- cited in the contract
of May 1927 [IS'°].

Later, on 18 Februaryy 1930 Siefert of

the Army Cryptologic Agency told CMAG that public use of
the pluggable reflector would violate the secret contract
of 1927 [ 136

On the

ev~dence

in the TICOM documents, it appears that

the Army forced a sudden change in tpe

~nigma,

already in

production, which gave a step-function improvement in its
security.

They also clamped the wartime secrecy law on every

aspect of the Enigma that concerned variable plugging. They
then "froze" the design (but not the embodiment) at that point
and refused to make any further improvement in Enigma security
even though CMAG patented improvements in motion and
plugging --- because the secrecy law only covered the 1927
keyboard-to-fast-wheel plugging.

No other improvements in

Enigma security were adopted until late in World War II when
they knew the machine was teing read.

The ¥oreign Office Reaction
The German Foreign Office (Auswaertiges Amt) was very
sensitive to COMSEC threats after the painful lesson of
World War I.

During the 1914-1918 war they had used

comparatively simple codes and enciphered code systems
~5"']

which they considered secure;

Then the publicity given

to the Zimmermann telegram by Admiral Hall showed the German
nation that their diplomatic ciphers were catastrophically
vulnerable.

This produced a major cipher crisis in 1917,

resulting in the Army breaking the main Foreign Office cipher
(see

As soon as the war ended the Foreign Office

abruptly changed to one-time pad encipherment, and their
messages frnm the Paris Peace Conference

The German Counterploy
The German Foreign Office in 1927 did not merely accept
the windfall of the Room 40 decrypts, but cleverly intimated
that they would contest the evidence on the grounds that the
1}.a-"]
messages were forgeries.
Peaslee, alarmed, asked Hall on
30 May 1927 if the British cryptanalysts who had done the
work could reproduce the dP.cryption and justify the reconstructio
j1.'3']
cf the codebooks.
Hall, who had kept in touch with some of
the Room 40 people, including Nigel de Grey (who waE then
('t.Sl]
running a rare book store) offered to produce the cipher books
and cipher experts and have the decipherment repeated in
{!3.(J
Peaslee's presence from the original German cipher text. He
told Peaslee to get the cipher texts from the "Washington
[2.3'0
telegraph office".
When the Germans were sure that the
decryption and the reconstruction of the codebooks could
be proved, they reversed their position, declaring, "The
stat~ments of Admiral Sir Reginald Hall will not be disputed"~q~
At the time the Zimmermann telegram was published, Hall had
gone to a lot of trouble to create the impression that the
plain text of the telegram had been obtained by the American
secret service, to conceal the code breaking and pinching of
11
German codebooks~' \\.he readiness of' Hall to repeat the decoding
gave the German cryptologists proof positive, which their
senior adminsirators had to accept, that the British had
actually decrypted their traffic and had not simply gotten
copies of the plaintexts somehow. The questions of inexact
language gave further proof that the codebooks had been
reconstructed, rather than merely stolen --- a further
revelation of British capability.
Apparently the purpose
of the German ploy was over the heads of Peaslee and Hall.

Detente and Security Policy

After Peaslee got copies of the decrypts out of England
in 1925, the British government could
if they actually
LJ,s2.] --

knew of the compromise --- have asked the U.S. and Peaslee
to keep them out of the hands of third par.ties because their
release was not consistent with U.S. or British policy towards
Germany. They could even have pointed out the possible
cryptographic benefit to Germany or other countries of knowing
the extent of Room 40 1 s success and the kinds of ciphers
that were solvable. But even though both the U.S. and Britain
were doing cryptanalysis in peacetime, and knew about each
['z.nA)
other's efforts, they couldn't admit it, and would have had to
base their ~guments on the impact of better cryptography in
a future war. An argument of this kind would have conflicted
{,I'S)
with the detente of the era. Peaslee, who believed that war
should be outlawed, was pursuing his case to punish German
aggression as a way of guaranteeing future peace --- so
arguments about future wars would have had an uphill struggle.
Security policy, secrecy and cryptanalysis had all..
'fr.
been subordinated to a belier in peace andAthe vicissitudes
of domestic politics in Britain for a long time. The
cryptanalytic activity which had run for three centuries in
complete secrecy was shut down in 1844 as a result of a
political struggle between Whigs, Radical and Tories at a time
when naval and industrial supremacy made secrecy and
communications intelligence seem unnecessary~As a result
Britain entered World War I without a cryptanalytic or radio
intelligence servicJ~Under wartime conditions there was
every motive for secrecy, to allow the good fortune of'
cryptanalytic exploi ta ti on to be continued~"] In spite of'
this, there were errors in usage that, combined with German
radio intelligence, caused the German Navy to change its
codes and ciphers and the source dried

and ~gent decrypts from Axis and neutral traffic continued~]

despite deception efforts. After the German Armistice
there was still the Russian problem, and Room 40 cryptanalysis
on Russian-German dipl0matic messages in the last year of the
war had a marked effect on British policy toward the new

changed their naval and diplomatic ciphers, and the war was

It is not clear whether Churchill's disclosures were authorized
by anyone else, although Churchill had been part of the

was believed that the Russians, who were engaged in secret
military projects with the Germans , had told them of the

messages easy to exploit, the disclosure would have downplayed

the British cryptanalytic capabilities~ 'fJEven though Admiralty
had lost administrative control of G.C.&C.S., the head of

they no longer had that responsibility. The political
exposure and leaking of intelligence results to affect
domestic politics came 1nto vogue. Later, in October 1924
just before a General Election, the Foreign Office and the
press publicized a notorious "Zinoviev Letter" which was
purported to be a secret communication from a noted Soviet
b.t"J
head of the Comintern. The "letter" was savagely critical
of the current British Labour leaders, who were friendly to
Russia, and it urged the British Communist Party to penetrate
fj.t;'O
the British Army and to promote revolutionary action. The

The Broken Dike
(1.1)

After the German sabotage and covert war decrypts had
been publicly transmitted to the German government in 1927
there was no way to keep the facts about Boom 40 out of the
public domein. The Ewing lecture of 13 December 1927 was
given to an audience of 1500 at Edinburgh, and reported fully
in the Times of 14 Dec 192~2.0JEwing received a flood of mail
afterwards asking for newspaper articles on how to defeat
" enemy cryptographers" 'ts1c..) J::3-ul •
George Young, who had been in charge of the political
section of Room 40 after Ewing left, co-authored a book on
naval disarmement in 1928 in which pe described more of the
work of Room 40, including the interesting fact that the
cryptAnalysts in Room 40 solved cipher messages "by the
technical methods ann. mar.hines they had invented . ..\\";)i.JJ The use
of machines in cryptanalysis was subsequently weighed by the
German Foreign Of~ice in rejecting the Enigma~Uil~all testified
at the 1930 trial at the Hague about the Black Tom sabotage.b1 'fl
Yardley was the first real cryptanalyst to disclose the actual
techniques used in war and peace, and he also disclosed facts
about British wartime and peacetime cryptanalysis and delivery
of peacetime cable traffic to the Admiralty (sic) in his 1931
book the American Black Chamber~u:tA law 48 Stat 122 (18 USC 952)
was passed to suppress a second Yardley book in 1933.it~
Secretary of State Lansing published more decrypts in 1935
in an autobiography~~~despite the new law and the furore over
the 1931 Yardley book.
One of the German agentR von Rintelen
published a book Dark Invader
in 1933 recounting many
conversations with Hall which disclosed details of Hall's
wRrtime activities. A book by H.C.Hoy in 1934 told more about

Room 40 decrypts. The French and the Germans apparently
5
published and released nothing~ IlHall himse~f had been directed
.
~3~
by the Briti.sh Government not to publish anything. One of
the interesting things about the Room 40 compromiRe is that
the material that got out only concerned German traffic or
German agents, although much of Room 40 1 s work was directed

at the traffic of neutrals~ The Nauen-Sayville link that
yielded a number of messages that Peaslee got was actually
run for U.S. diplomatic and commercial traffic between Germany
~3'fJ
and the U .. S. and the imbedded German cipher messages and
133.5']
diplomatic notes were sent in a code known to the U.s": Presumably
U.S. cable and radio traffic, like that of other neutrals, went
{;3()
to Room 40, but whatever happened to it is still shielded by
secrecy. Another point is that almost all the information
about Room 40 was revealed by high ranking people, once
Peaslee managed to get the decrypts out of England. Except
for that starting crack, the wall of secrecy might have held
as well for the German materials which did escape as it held
fQr the other decrypts and intelligence which did not escape.

The Effect of the Room 40 Disclosures

The German TICOM documents do not refer directly to
the Room 40 decrypts, so the effects of the disclosures

must be inferred. The cipher crisis of 1917 is illuminating
in showing German reaction to cipher insecurity (see Appendix).

Righteousness and Government Secrecy
The available evidence indicates a compromise of the
